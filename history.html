The College was founded by him on 3rd July, 1944 and was affiliated to Utkal University with intermediate Arts and Commerce. It was upgraded to a Degree College in July,1946 with the instruction of the B.A. (pass) class. The institution attained the status of a full-fledged Degree College after the affiliation of the B.Com. Class in 1964-65 and B.Sc. class in 1965-66. P.G. teaching started from the session 1978-79.Since 1st January, 1967 the College has been under Sambalpur University.The College was granted AUTONOMY for a period of five years with effect from 01-04-2002 by the U.G.C. vide their letter no F2-2-2000 (Desk-AC) dt.26.02.2002 followed by concurrence by the Sambalpur Univerisity vide their letter no.1042/Dev.
